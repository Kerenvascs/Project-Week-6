## Project Description
For the final project of the Statistical module I chose to do marketing analysis of a bank campaign in Portugal, i chose that topic because i really wanted to work with a real-world problem, besides that, telemarketing calls can be very expansive and I wanted to identify the best customer profile to improve the marketing campaign and improve its results.

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions
My business question is:  Wich costumer will subscribe for a bank deposit?

<a name="dataset"></a>

## Dataset
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.
